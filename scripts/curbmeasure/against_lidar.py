"""Measure kerbs from photographs where lidar already measured them.

This is the only test that means anything at kerb scale. Agreement with sparse triangulation was
established at 37 m, because that is the only range where sparse features exist; the five to ten
metres where a kerb sits has none to compare against, so the check has to come from outside the
photographs entirely.

The measurement code is imported from the sibling project rather than reimplemented. Running a
different estimator here would confound whether the sensors agree with whether the estimators do
-- the mistake that produced a spurious 50 mm bias between the aerial and Waymo lidar earlier.
