# Curb measurements from street photography

Measures kerb height and footway width from ordinary street-level photographs, by multi-view
stereo on camera poses that somebody else already solved.

## Why this is tractable

The hard part of measuring anything from a photograph is scale. A picture of a kerb is a picture
of a kerb at any size; recovering the metre requires either a ranging sensor or a reconstruction
anchored to something of known length, and errors in that anchor are systematic — they do not
average away no matter how many photographs you add.

Mapillary has already solved it. Every image in their catalogue carries `computed_rotation`,
`computed_geometry` and `atomic_scale`: a solved camera orientation, an SfM-refined position, and
the metric scale of the reconstruction it belongs to. Measured over a San Francisco test box, 100%
of 789 images had all three, with `atomic_scale` clustering at 0.99 (p10 0.89, p90 1.08) and a
median nearest-neighbour camera spacing of **1.09 m**.

That spacing is what makes this work. With a 1.09 m baseline and a ~3,400 px focal length,
triangulation precision is:

```
σ_depth ≈ Z² / (f · B) · σ_disparity        at σ_disparity = 0.3 px

  Z =  5 m  →   ~2 mm
  Z = 10 m  →   ~8 mm
  Z = 20 m  →  ~32 mm
```

A kerb is about 130 mm. Inside ten metres — which is where a kerb beside a camera actually is —
this resolves it.

## What was ruled out first, and why

**Monocular metric depth.** The obvious idea, and it does not work at this scale of feature.
Benchmarked on street imagery, the best models (UniDepth-Base, Metric3D-ViT) reach 5.6–5.7 m mean
absolute error, and 1.2–2.4 m even under five metres. A kerb is 0.15 m. The error is an order of
magnitude larger than the thing being measured.

**Mapillary's published `mesh`.** Per-image and free, but it is the sparse SfM cloud triangulated:
452 vertices and 868 faces for a whole street scene, roughly one vertex per 4,000 pixels. Fine for
scene structure, far too coarse for a kerb face.

## Ground truth

Measurements are checked against 9,376 kerb heights measured from USGS 3DEP aerial lidar in the
sibling project, which were themselves cross-validated against Waymo ground-level lidar and agreed
to within 1 mm of median. Nothing from this pipeline should be believed until it has been put
against those.

## What the validation found

Poses were checked before anything was built on them, by triangulating SIFT matches between two
images and reprojecting into a **third** that took no part in the triangulation.

Mapillary's poses are good, *within a sequence*:

```
rotation disagreement vs the pixels' own essential matrix   median 0.86°   p90 3.11°
baseline direction disagreement                             median 4.79°   p90 41.0°
consecutive baseline                                        median 2.05 m
```

Reprojection accuracy after geometric verification:

```
depth band      n    median err (px)   within 3 px
  0-  5 m       0          -
  5- 10 m       9       9444             0%
 10- 20 m     117       7.95            15%
 20- 40 m     249       4.58            25%
 40-120 m     930      29.00            14%
```

**Sparse feature matching cannot measure a kerb, and the reason is not the poses.** There are
essentially no matchable features in the near field: SIFT keys on facades, signage and distant
structure, while the five metres of road and footway beside the camera are low-texture asphalt
and concrete. The band where a kerb actually lives returns nothing to triangulate.

That is what makes the dense step mandatory rather than an optimisation. Dense methods —
plane-sweep, SGBM, the patch-match in `opensfm/dense.py` — do not need distinctive points; they
match every pixel with a local window and a smoothness prior, which is exactly what a texture-poor
road surface requires.

## Three mistakes worth recording

Each produced a confident, wrong conclusion, and each was a fault in the test rather than in the
data:

1. **Comparing `t` from `recoverPose` against a baseline direction.** OpenCV returns the
   translation of the transform, not the camera centre; the centre is `-Rᵀt`. This reported a 66°
   disagreement where there was almost none.
2. **Grouping by `merge_cc` and sorting by capture time.** A merge component can span several
   separate drives, so "consecutive" pairs were wide-baseline pairs of different streets pointing
   different ways. This reported 110° of rotation error. Grouping by `sequence` first fixed it.
3. **Triangulating unverified matches.** A ratio test leaves confident mismatches, and a
   mismatched pair does not fail loudly — it triangulates somewhere plausible and reprojects
   hundreds of pixels away, which reads as a pose problem. Essential-matrix RANSAC before
   triangulation cut the 10–40 m error from 32 px to 4.6 px.

## Hardware this has to run on

Apple M4, 10 CPU cores (4P/6E), 10 GPU cores, 16 GB unified memory, Metal 3. **No CUDA**, so
COLMAP's dense stereo is unavailable and anything GPU-bound has to go through MPS or Metal.

Disk is the harder limit: **13 GB free**. At 1024 px the full 92,834-image catalogue is 32 GB and
at 2048 px it is 109 GB, so images can never all be resident. The pipeline streams — fetch a
working set, measure, delete the pixels, keep only the measurements.

## Plane sweep with semi-global aggregation

`src/curbmeasure/stereo.py`. Inverse-depth plane hypotheses, homography warps of each neighbour
into the reference, ZNCC cost, then semi-global aggregation along four directions before the
minimum is taken. Sub-plane refinement fits a parabola to the winning cost and its neighbours.

Winner-take-all was tried first and does not work on this material: ninety-six hypotheses give
noise ninety-six chances to beat a signal, and plain asphalt has no signal to beat. The depth
profile came out compressed into 3–5 m across the whole frame. With aggregation it spans 13.7 m
at the top of the swept band to 2.7 m at the bottom, which is what a road seen from a moving
camera should do.

Two details earned their place:

*The margin test excludes a neighbourhood of the winner.* Aggregation smooths the cost curve, so
the adjacent plane is always a close second; testing against it rejected 92% of pixels while
saying nothing about ambiguity. The runner-up has to be a genuinely different surface.

*P2 is relieved at image edges.* A kerb is a depth discontinuity, and a smoothness penalty that
does not yield at edges is a smoothness penalty that erases the feature being measured.

## Validation

Against sparse triangulation on the same pixels of the same image — the sparse path having been
checked independently by reprojection into a held-out third view:

```
92 pixels with both a swept and a triangulated depth
  triangulated depth        median 37.56 m
  swept depth               median 41.76 m
  ratio                     median 1.060   p25 0.999   p75 1.151
```

**The sweep agrees with validated triangulation to about 6%.** A road plane fitted by RANSAC to
the swept ground comes out flat to **25 mm rms** over 4,825 inliers at a 2.5% slope.

Runtime is 3–4 s per reference view on Metal for 325,000 pixels, 96 planes, 4 neighbours.

### What is still open

*Acceptance in the ground band is 14%.* Most ground pixels still get no depth. Usable, since a
kerb is measured from a run of surface rather than a single pixel, but it should be higher.

*The 6% agreement is measured at 37 m,* because that is where sparse features are. The error at
5–10 m, where a kerb actually is, is not yet known and cannot be established this way — there are
no sparse features there to compare against. Only the lidar ground truth can settle it.

*One earlier conclusion here was wrong.* A reconstructed road sitting 0.72 m below the camera was
read as a systematic depth-scale error, on the assumption that these cameras are vehicle-mounted
at about 2.5 m. The comparison above shows there is no such scale error. Mapillary's contributors
shoot from bicycles, helmets and handheld phones, and the mount height is not known per sequence —
so camera height was never a valid yardstick.
