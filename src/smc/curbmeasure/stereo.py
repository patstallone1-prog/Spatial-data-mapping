"""Plane-sweep stereo over the ground in front of a camera.

Sparse feature matching cannot see a kerb. Measured on this corpus it returns nothing at all
inside five metres, because SIFT keys on facades and signage while the road and footway beside
the camera are flat grey concrete. Dense matching does not need distinctive points: it scores
every pixel against a window of its neighbours and lets a smoothness assumption carry the
texture-poor stretches.

The sweep is the classical one. For each hypothesised depth, the plane at that depth induces a
homography from each neighbouring view into the reference view; warping by it and comparing to
the reference gives a cost per pixel, and the depth whose warp agrees best wins. Two choices are
worth stating because they are what make it affordable here:

*Only the lower part of the frame is swept.* A kerb is on the ground, and the sky and upper
facades are most of the pixels and none of the answer.

*Depths are spaced evenly in inverse depth, not in depth.* Disparity is linear in inverse depth,
so uniform depth steps oversample the far field and undersample the near -- and the near field
is the whole point.

Cost is zero-mean normalised cross-correlation over a small window, which is invariant to the
exposure differences between frames taken seconds apart with automatic metering.
