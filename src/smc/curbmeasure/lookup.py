"""Fetch image poses one id at a time, and keep them.

The bounding-box search is what gets throttled. Measured against the same token in the same
minute, a box query downtown is refused with "Please reduce the amount of data you're asking
for" while twenty-five per-id lookups return cleanly at five a second. The metadata for every
image in the corridor was already harvested into the sibling project, so the search can be
skipped entirely: the ids are known, and the ids are all the per-id endpoint needs.

Poses are cached to disk on arrival. A run that is interrupted after two hours should resume
where it stopped rather than start again, and nothing here is expensive enough to be worth
fetching twice.
